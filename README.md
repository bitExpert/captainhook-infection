# bitexpert/captainhook-infection

This package provides an action for [Captain Hook](https://github.com/CaptainHookPhp/captainhook) 
which will invoke [InfectionPHP](https://infection.github.io) for all changed files of a commit. Running InfectionPHP
only against the changed files will result in faster response times which is ideal when running it via a pre-commit or
pre-push hook.
